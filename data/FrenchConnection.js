  description: `
    <i>The French Connection</i> follows the life of Nicholas Lanier, a French
    lutenist who fled to England escaping religious persecution and went on to gain the title
    'Master of the King's Music' in the court of Charles I and II. Nicholas' grandfather had
    been court composer to Henry II of France, so this performance weaves music and poetry
    together to paint a picture of courtly life across the channel.
